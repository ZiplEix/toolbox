# 🛠️ Toolbox

Welcome to my personal **Toolbox**.

This repository is a monorepo that centralizes my experiments, daily tools, and various prototypes. It serves as an "organized draft" space where I test new technologies, interface concepts, or utility scripts.

## 🎯 Goal

The idea is to avoid scattering my small projects across dozens of distinct repos, but to group them here to:
- Facilitate code reuse.
- Have a ready-to-use playground.
- Maintain a collection of self-hosted tools.

## 📦 Content

The project revolves mainly around a web interface (Frontend) that serves as a dashboard and showcase for the different modules.

- **Frontend**: A modern application (SvelteKit 5 + Tailwind 4) grouping the graphical interfaces of the tools.
- **UI Kit**: A home-grown component library currently under development.
- **Experiments**: Various scripts and POCs (Proof of Concepts).

## 🚀 Project Status

This is a living, personal project. The code is constantly evolving; some parts may be broken or undergoing a complete overhaul. Feel free to dig around for inspiration!
